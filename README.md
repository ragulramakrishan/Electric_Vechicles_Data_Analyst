# Key_Insights
 - 150,413 electric vehicles are on the road in the US, with 77.6% being Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 22.4% being Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
 - Tesla dominates the market with 52.7% market share, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, and BMW.
 - The average electric range of EVs is 67.83 miles, making them a viable option for daily commutes.
 - BEVs are leading the charge, with the top 3 models being Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3, and Nissan Leaf.

 # Dashboard
 I have also designed a dashboard in Tableau which considers the important factors.
